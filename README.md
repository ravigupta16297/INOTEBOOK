# INOTEBOOK

 This app uses JS ,reactjs ,html, css, and bootstrap for frontend and express js ,nodejs and mongodb on the backend part.
 
Although  I have rough knowledge about express js and nodejs , I took help from internet to connect my app  to database.

This app includes user login and logout facility and it uses authtoken to verify the identity of the user 

Once the user logins successfully , he gets a timer  and the list of notes earlier saved by him

Once the user hit the start button the timer starts and now the user can either reset the time or click on save to add a note in his database at that particular timestamp\

I have also included the editing and deleting option for the user, so that he can update his notes or delete it if he wants
